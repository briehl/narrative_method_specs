    <p>The &quot;Insert Genomes into Species Tree&quot; app allows a user to determine evolutionary relationships between organisms based on the differences in their genomic sequences. In this app, the user may either upload genomes into KBase or select from existing genomes already in KBase. KBase will then recruit these genomes into a species tree. KBase will also select a specified number of phylogenetically close genomes from the KBase reference genome database to also include in the tree. The tree object may be exported or viewed in KBase.</p>

step-descriptions :
    step_1 : |
        Construct a species tree containing all supplied genomes 
    step_2 : |
        Build a new genome set containing all genomes included in the species tree
