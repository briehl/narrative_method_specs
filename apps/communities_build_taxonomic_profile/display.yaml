    <p>This app makes it possible to generate taxonomic annotation abundance profiles and normalize the data for a selected set of metagenomes. You can use search to create a list of metagenomes, and then specify options that define the various attributes (e.g., annotation e-value, percent identity, level) to restrict the data that will be returned. The most critical parameters for creating a profile (besides inputting the metagenome(s) you want to include along with output name) are the taxa level (for example, do you want at the Genus or perhaps Phylum level) and source you want to base your annotation on (Source Name). The second part of this app normalizes/standardizes the abundance profile data (log-transformation) to reduce bias (experimental or technical) among profiles, making them more comparable and reducing the chance of erroneous conclusions driven by non-biological trends in the data. Box plots are generate for both raw and normalized data to display the distribution. The output of this app is an abundance profile for one or more metagenomes. The abundance profile contains the raw annotation abundance data returned for the selected set of data attributes. Abundance profiles serve as the inputs for all other community related apps: normalization, vizualizations (PCoA, heatmap-dendrograms, and rank abundance plots) to look for trends in the data, and statistical anlayses to identify the taxa or functions that drive these trends.</p>

step-descriptions :
    step_1 : |
        Specify the list of metagenomes and the attributes that will define the data that will be returned as an abundance profile. Returns a view of the abundance profile in table and boxplot format.
    step_2 : |
        Normalize abundance data for selected abundance profile. Returns a view of the abundance profile in table and boxplot format.
