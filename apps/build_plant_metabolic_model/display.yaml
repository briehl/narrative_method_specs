    <p>The Build Plant Metabolic Model app builds a metabolic model, using the annotation data from an annotated Genome object derived from PlantSEEDModels, to reconstruct the metabolic reactions that the cell is capable of performing. It then performs gapfilling, by searching for and subsequently bridging the missing metabolic reactions that were not found in the initial annotation search.</p>

    step_1 : |
        additional instructions/details regarding the step with id step_1
    step_2 : |
        additional instructions/details regarding the step with id step_2
